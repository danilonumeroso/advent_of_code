# Advent of Code

This is my personal space for tackling the coding challenges of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (starting from year 2023).
Overall, I found (and keep finding!) it a fun challenge that also makes you learn new things along the way.

## Notes
Solutions are usually crafted to be the most elegant (to my taste, at least!), even though elegance must take a backseat to
performance and efficiency sometimes :)
