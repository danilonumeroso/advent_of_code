This answer can be obtained by a fully algebraic approach, which I found on this amazing Reddit post:

The key idea here is to find this invariance: (Vi-Vj) \\cross (Pi-Pj) \\dot X = (Vi-Vj) \\dot Pi \\cross Pj 
Where X is the answer we are looking for, and Pi and Vi are the coordinates/velocity of the i-th hailstone.
To find all three P-coordinates we need three equations, so we need three hailstones. The above equation
can be written in matrix form as:

Ax = b  ==> x = A^-1 * b

where A is a 3x3 matrix where each row is (Vi-Vj) \\cross (Pi-Pj) and b is a 3x1 vector where each row is
(Vi-Vj) \\dot Pi \\cross Pj.

To solve this, I input these equations in WolframAlpha to get the answer.
